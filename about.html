						Milky was a 5-month-old puppy who had been living with her family for two months. She loved to explore and try new things. One night Milky decided to investigate the bed and climbed up on it. Unfortunately, she was a bit too excited and she fell off the bed and onto the floor with a loud thump.
						<p></p>
						At first, Milky was scared and began to whimper. But then she realized that she was okay and she began to wag her tail and bark with excitement. Her family came running into the room to see what the commotion was all about. When they saw Milky's happy face they couldn't help but smile and laugh.
						<p></p>
						Milky had learned her lesson and was more careful the next time she decided to investigate the bed. From then on, she was always excited to jump on the bed and curl up with his family.
						<p></p>
						The end.
