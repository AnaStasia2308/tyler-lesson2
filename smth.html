Papa was sound asleep in his bed one night when he heard a loud thud coming from the corner of the room. When he opened his eyes he saw the source of the noise - a little white puppy had fallen out of bed!
<p></p>
He immediately got up and scooped her up in his arms. He was so surprised that he had no idea what to do next. So he just cradled her in his arms and rocked her back and forth until she stopped crying. 
<p></p>
Papa was so relieved that Milky was okay, he decided to keep her as his own pet. He gave her a bath, bought her some toys, and taught her some tricks. As it turns out, Milky was the best, most loving dog Papa had ever owned! 
<p></p>
The two of them were inseparable from that day forward, and Papa was so grateful for his newfound furry friend. He was so happy that he was able to save Milky and give her a loving, safe home.
